# Zeebe Cluster Helm Chart

This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Requirements

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= 3.x + 
* Kubernetes >= 1.18+
* Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with default settings. All of these settings are configurable.
  * Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
  * 1GB of RAM for the JVM heap


## Installing

* Add the official Zeebe helm charts repo

  ```shell
  helm repo add zeebe https://helm.camunda.io
  ```

* Install it

  ```shell
  helm install zb zeebe/zeebe-cluster-helm
  ```

## Examples

### Env Example
```yaml

env:
  - name: ZEEBE_GATEWAY_MONITORING_ENABLED
    value: "true"
```


## Adding dynamic exporters to Zeebe Brokers

This chart supports the addition of Zeebe Exporters by using initContainer as shown in the following example:

```
extraInitContainers: |
  - name: init-exporters-hazelcast
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
    args: ['wget --no-check-certificate https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zeebe/hazelcast/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter/0.8.0-alpha1/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter-0.8.0-alpha1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -O /exporters/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter.jar; ls -al']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: exporters
      mountPath: /exporters/
  - name: init-exporters-kafka
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
    args: ['wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kafka-exporter/releases/download/1.1.0/zeebe-kafka-exporter-1.1.0-uber.jar -O /exporters/zeebe-kafka-exporter.jar; ls -al']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: exporters
      mountPath: /exporters/    
env:
  ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_HAZELCAST_JARPATH: exporters/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter.jar
  ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_HAZELCAST_CLASSNAME: io.zeebe.hazelcast.exporter.HazelcastExporter
  ZEEBE_HAZELCAST_REMOTE_ADDRESS: "{{ .Release.Name }}-hazelcast"  
```
This example is downloading the exporters Jar from an URL and adding the Jars to the `exporters` directory that will be scanned for jars and added to the zeebe broker classpath. Then with `environment variables` you can configure the exporter parameters. 

## Dependencies

This chart currently depends on the following charts:

* [ElasticSearch Helm Chart](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/README.md)
* [Kibana Helm Chart](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/tree/master/kibana)
* [Prometheus Operator Helm Chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator)

These dependencies can be turned on or off and parameters can be overriden from these dependent charts by changing the `values.yaml` file. For example:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
  imageTag: <YOUR VERSION HERE>
kibana:
  enabled: false
```

## Development

For development purpose you might want to deploy and test the charts without creating a new release. In order to do this you can run the following:

```sh
 helm install <RELEASENAME> charts/zeebe-cluster-helm/
```

If you see errors like:

```sh
Error: found in Chart.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: elasticsearch, kibana, kube-prometheus-stack
```

Then you need to download the depenencies first. You can do this via:

```sh
$ helm dependency update charts/zeebe-cluster-helm/
